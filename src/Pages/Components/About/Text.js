            MURIOUS, the three days panorama, has established a name for itself, 
            as the place to be in, just by the virtue of the quality of events organized by Technical Sciences, Movies and Photography Club,
            the Technical Sciences, Movies and Photography Club at JUIT and the poise with which they are held. The Technical festival will be an extravaganza of magnitude composed of technical events and
            shows along with demonstrations of great brains with the fun events like Click and Blink,
            Spot the Bug, Web Wizard, Valorant, Tech Talks, Code Quest and Code Trails.
